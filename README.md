# Hamiltonian-Memory-Layer
Physics-inspired Hamiltonian Memory Layer for long-context sequence modeling

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This repository is a **work in progress**.  
> The Hamiltonian Memory Layer (HML) project explores physics-inspired architectures for long-context sequence modeling.  
> Early prototype code, experiments, and notes are being developed here and will be expanded into a full **arXiv paper + workshop submission**.  
> If you are interested in collaborating, please open an issue or contact me.
